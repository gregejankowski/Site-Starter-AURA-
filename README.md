# Experience Cloud Site Starter (AURA)
The Experience Cloud Site Starter (AURA) is a mobile 1st site design for a self-service site using best practices (e.g., flexible pages), using no-code, low-code,  CSS, and HTML components.

This package contains:
* **Site Starter (AURA) Template**
    This template provides a clean theme (minimal pages) using flexible layouts for all pages.
    Templates are selected when creating a new site or changing the Template. This will overwrite all site pages and the theme.

    The site includes builder notes as an aide to help setup and configure the pages. These notes should be removed before publishing the site.

    When creating or update a non-object and non-CMS page types, a page layout called **Template** is included to get a new page started.
